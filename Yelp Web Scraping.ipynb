    "And before we can get any reviews on restaurants, we might want to get the metadata on ALL of the Indian restaurants in Houston. According to Yelp, there are ~264, but our function yelp_search from yelp_classwork.ipynb only returns 20 of them. This is due to pagination and is a safeguard against returning __TOO__ much data in a single request (what would happen if there were 100,000 restaurants?) and can be used in conjuction with _rate limiting_ as well as a way to throttle and protect access to Yelp data.\n",

    "50 records per second, 20,000 seconds for 1,000,000 records.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways that APIs are an improvement over plain web scraping is the ability to make __parameterized__ requests. Just like the Python functions you have been writing have arguments (or parameters) that allow you to customize its behavior/actions (an output) without having to rewrite the function entirely, we can parameterize the queries we make to the Yelp API to filter the results it returns."
